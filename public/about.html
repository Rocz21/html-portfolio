<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a Procurement professional with a Bachelor of Arts degree and three years of working experience in a fast-paced, manufacturing company.
</p>

<p>
  As a purchasing coordinator, my primary responsibilities covered all purchase order creations in both ERP systems SRM & SAP in the 
  categories of Commerce, Business Services, Supply Chain, and Raw & Packaging Materials. I assisted all contract managers with timely orders, 
  vendor creation, and management of more than 600 suppliers both locally and internationally, requiring a high level of confidentiality, and managing multiple financial and legal documents.   
</p>

<p>
  I provided my team with accurate monthly and year-to-date reporting to maintain contract compliance and analysis to help drive full contract coverage and mitigate overdue or late payments to the suppliers. 
  My main focus and drive encompass teamwork, collaborative result-oriented partnerships, and growth in knowledge and expertise.
